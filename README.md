# Double-pendulums
simulation of motion of multiple double pendulums

This program file allows the user to input a set of double pendulums
containing the initial information of all the angles and speeds, and produces
a simulation of its motion over time. The model of the simulation is based on
using normal euler's method on the complicated second order differential
equations. The state space of the each independent pendulum was also plotted.
