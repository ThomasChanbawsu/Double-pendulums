# Introduction of the files/project (12/2021)
simulation of motion of multiple double pendulums

This program file allows the user to input a set of double pendulums
containing the initial information of all the angles and speeds, and produces
a simulation of its motion over time. The model of the simulation is based on
using numerical methods on the complicated second order differential
equations. The methods used include the normal euler method and the runge kutta 4th order method.
Additional plots include the angular displacement of pendulums over time, plots of the angles against their respective angular speed
as well as the energy of the system estimated by the method over time.

# Physics of the double pendulum
The double pendulum is a simple system that consists of a second bob attached to an upper bob, which is fixed by a pivot. The motion of a double pendulum
is often studied by scientists as it reflects behaviours of a chaotic system. One distinctive features with chaotic systems is their sensitivity to the initial
conditions your system starts with. What this implies is if you place the two double pendulums at very close but not the same conditions of $\theta$ and $\dot{\theta}$, you observe two different trajectories traced by them over time. Inevitably, this chaotic nature makes it hard to predict the movements of a system over time.
This discovery was first made by meteorologist Edward Lorenz when he studied about a set of equations in an attempt to model atmospheric convections. These later came to be known as the Lorenz system, which established the popular media idea of the 'butterfly effect'.
The second order differential equations of the motion were derived by using the Euler-Lagrange equation on the lagrangian of the system. They are then rewritten
in a form where the angular displacements and angular speeds act as variables. The equation is then ran by a numerical integration using either Euler's method or 
Runge-Kutte 4th order method.

# Comparison between Euler's method and Runge-Kutta 4th order method
Overall, both method do appear to be functional in creating a simulation of our double pendulum problem. Based on the first seconds of the simulation,
the motion of the double pendulum does abide our physical intuition and expected observation. However, something catastrophic occurs in our Eulers method
simulation. This is best shown in the figure below.

The above figure shows the plots of the angular displacements by both models over time as well as the time evolution of energy based on a given input of initial
conditions. Energy of the sytem is plotted as a purpose of a benchmark, to see how closely accurate our simulation is to an actual physical system.
Notice how for Euler's method, the amplitude and energy significantly increases over time. This is
an unavoidable consequence due to the result of a growing truncating error. It is believed that the accuracy of our result is negatively correlated by the number of computations a computer needs to process. By setting a small discrete time step (about 0.005 seconds) in the simulation, the individual rounding errors from each computation accumulated a lot over the process, causing the model to blow up over time. 
This can be reduced by further minimizing the time discretion, but this will lead to a tradeoff for expensive computation cost and time.

In contrast, the RK4 model is observed to be more accurate and stable over the same period of time. It can be clearly seen that the fluctuations of both angular displacements is not as big as the ones in Euler's method. But more importantly, the deviation of the approximated energy away from the energy of the system
is not as extreme as the other model. Final error in energy is probably 3 times smaller than that of Euler's method as seen in the graph. This big improvement
in accuracy originates from the fact that the truncating error produced by RK4 method is around a 4th order of accuracy. In other words, this error would be in a magnitude smaller than the time-step we used. From this graph alone, it is obvious to tell that the model of double pendulum generated by the RK4 method is closer to our actual case. The RK4 method is a more justifiable and accurate model in simulating physics (at least in this case) than the simple Euler's method.

Despite the high performance described earlier, that doesn't mean the RK4 model is perfect. To achieve a 'perfect simulation' (which may be feasibly hard), the energy of our simulation should stay constant so as not to violate a fundamental law of nature. Certain studies have suggested that sympletic integrators should
be looked into and utilised for these type of systems.



# Sidenote from author
This is just a personal project I whipped up for fun, namely to use my coding skills on something I'm compassionate about, physics, and to serve it as a challenge for myself.
If anyone knows a bit about chaos theory or bifurcation, I am curious to new ideas that you think I can incorporate them
into my program. It may be a matter of whether this is within my level of knowledge, but any suggestions is welcome!
